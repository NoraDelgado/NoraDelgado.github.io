								<h3>Introduction</h3>
								<p>In this project, I analyzed historical trip data to gain insights into the usage patterns of annual members and casual riders, aiming to design an effective marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members and maximize Cyclistic's success.</p>
								
								<h3>Goal</h3>
								<p>Provide valuable insights to the marketing team about how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. Counsel the marketing team to develop a strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.</p>
							
							</div>

								<h3>Results</h3>
								<p>The project's results are presented through a <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/BikeShare_Project_Portfolio/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link" target="_blank">Tableau</a> visualization, offering a clear representation of the data analysis. In addition, a concise report at the end of this page is included, summarizing the key conclusions and recommendations.</p>

						<h2>Case - How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?</h2>
						<dl>
							<p>I conducted an analysis to understand the differences in Cyclistic bike usage between annual members and casual riders. The insights include the count of annual rides by rider type, frequency of usage by month, and Bike type preference by rider type. Stakeholders can refer to an interactive <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/BikeShare_Project_Portfolio/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link" target="_blank">Tableau</a> dashboard for more details, and all the analysis <a href="https://github.com/NoraDelgado/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/--%20SQL%20CODE%20FOR%20BIKESHARE%20PROJECT.txt" target="_blank">SQL</a> code is available for reference.</p>

					<h2>Key Findings, Conclusions, and Recommendations: </h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Between April 2021 and March 2022 (12 months), there were 4,605,083 total rides, with 56% completed by members and 44% by casual riders.</li>
						<li>Both casual riders and members mostly used classic bikes, followed by electric bikes. However, casual riders utilized docked bikes more frequently compared to members. To convert casual riders into Cyclistic members, it is recommended to focus on promoting the use of docked bikes.</li>
						<li>Hotter months experienced a higher number of riders compared to colder months. To maximize awareness of the scheme, targeted advertisements should be run during the summer.</li>
						<li>Cyclistic members, on average, have shorter ride durations than casual riders. To attract more casual riders and convert them into members, promotions should emphasize longer ride options.</li>
						<li>Members primarily ride on weekdays, while casual riders prefer weekends. Promotional efforts should highlight the benefits of using Cyclistic for daily commuting or school trips to attract more users during weekdays.</li>
						<li>A significant number of rides occur on Saturdays and Sundays for both members and casual riders. Running advertising campaigns on weekends can help increase awareness and attract more casual riders to join the scheme.</li>
